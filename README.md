# UCF_Final_SelfAssessment

## Self Assessment

My main role during the project was the database role, however I also assisted in visualization, the presentation and the readme to help the project succeed. 

For the dataabse, I obtained the data frames that were cleaned using Pandas as csv files and imported them into a Postgres database. Using SQL I joined the cleaned tables and created a new table. I then made the database available in AWS for use in the Machine Learning models and the visualizations. Additionally I used Esri's ArcGIS Pro which I connected to the Postgres database to create time series maps which I then saved as videos. 

During the project I helped with the presentation and the readme. Additionally I was involved in team discussions on the machine learning portion of the project, additional visualizations that could be conducted in Tableu and changes to the readme.

During the project my technical challenge was making the the AWS instance available to other team members. I reviewed the modules, searched for answers using Google Searches and had to try a number of things to get it to work. The other challenge I faced was dealing with the team direction. Our dataset had lots of data and there were many questions we could ask, during meetings we would keep coming up with different questions we could ask and different datasets we could try to find. This took a lot of discussion to determine the final questions and direction we wanted for the analysis. This is something that was beneficial for me, in my job we almost always know the questions we are trying to answer we just need to figure out how to do it. This project required me to take a step back and work with others to determine the questions before we could figure out how to answer the questions.  

## Team Assessment

There were five members of our team and they were: Kirsten, Deanna, Gilda, Jeanine and Zoe. At the beginning of the project we found a dataset that could be used. The dataset had a lot of data which allowed us to:
 - ask many different questions of the data
 - perform cleaning on the data to distill it down to a dataset that allows us to answer our questions

To communicate we set up a slack channel and exchanged emails and phone numbers. We also set up a group text chat to allow us to communicate and to use during the final presentation.

One of the challenges we faced was agreeing upon the questions we wanted to answer with the analysis. The data contained a lot of informaiton so there were many questions that could be answered. When we would get together we kept discussing different questions that could be answered with the dataset. It took a while for us to agree upon what the questions we would ask were and this delayed the analysis. If I were to do the project again I would suggest trying to determine the questions we wanted to answer earlier in the process. With our assignments the questions we were answering was documented at the beginning of the module. For our project we had completed some cleaning and database work beforing agreeing on the questions we wanted to answer which resulted in having to redo some of the initial data preparation work.   

One of the strenghts of our team was our willingness to step in where necessary. We had multiple people who stepped in to help with the machine learning, the visualizations, the presentation and the readme file. The deliverables were a team effort and this made the project successful. For future cohorts I would recommend relying on your team mates and not sticking strictly to the roles you originally chose when the project started.  

## Summary of Project

Our final team project was an analysis of US Declared Disasters. We obtained a dataset from kaggle and ran analysis to determine the states and regions with the most number of declared disasters. We performed some initial data cleaning in Pandas then imported the data into a Postgres database. 

The machine learning consists of two algorithms that attenpted to predict a time series. This would help us determine if it was possible to determine regions where more declared disasters would occur. The analysis showed an increase in declared disasters in the West Region.    

The data was then used for visualizations using both Esri's ArcGIS Pro and Tableau. The GIS visualizations showed time-series of declared disasters by both state and region for the 40 year analysis period.

The tableau visualizations also showed increases in the number of declared disasters in the West region.
